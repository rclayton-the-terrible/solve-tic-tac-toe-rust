# Solve Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a really simple example project (in Rust -- because I'm trying to learn the language) on ways to evaluate the results of a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

This is a common question asked during technical interviews ([I saw this on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/miuam0/a_google_interview_question_determine_if_someone/))and it made me think, "how would I go about doing it?"

In this repo, we will try two methods:

1.  Nested Loops.
2.  Bitwise comparison of winning board positions.

The [original blogger](https://jrms-random-blog.blogspot.com/2021/03/a-google-interview-question.html) mentioned a third option (hashing all possible winning combos and looking up the result), I'm just not sure how I would attempt that in a way that is novel from the bitwise approach.
